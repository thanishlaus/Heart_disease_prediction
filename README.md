# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using **Machine Learning Pipelines** by analyzing medical data. The system processes patient data, applies feature engineering, and utilizes trained models to assess heart disease risk with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes medical records for accurate predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifies key health indicators influencing heart disease.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Uses ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Accepts user input to assess heart disease risk dynamically.
- **Automated ML Pipeline**: Ensures smooth data flow from ingestion to prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Deployment**: Flask (for API), Streamlit (for UI), Docker (for containerization)

## 📊 Dataset
- Utilizes the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**, containing patient records with attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
